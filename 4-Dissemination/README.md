# ProjectName
## 4-Dissemination
- Description: As the name says, this is a central location to keep organized
               any documents related to disseminating your research findings to
               the scientific and wider community. This is where your journal
               articles will reside, but also any conference papers or posters
               which report the experimental findings. Not to be dismissed –
               this is the 21st century, after all – is any media coverage and
               publicity, such as newspaper interviews, articles, and the like.
